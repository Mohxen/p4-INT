#device, uAInstruction, nextHopIpv6, nextHopMac

#64 bits mask for the uAInstruction, it it's a match, nextHopIpv6 will be used as argument to action srv6_usid_ua
#just like uN but with a bit shift of 32 but will NOT be used to get the next MAC, 
#the IP value to use will the arg value (nextHopIpv6)

#The previous entry will (in the same switch) trigger xconnect_act, that by using the value defined in nextHopIpv6, 
#will set as next hop (nextHopMac)


#Change IP to the uN of r4 and change the nextHopMac to the MAC of r4 (r9->r4)
uA-insert device:r9  fcbb:bb00:9:fa94:: fcbb:bb00:4:: 00:aa:00:00:00:04

#Change IP to the uN of r5 and change the nextHopMac to the MAC of r5 (r10->r5)
uA-insert device:r10 fcbb:bb00:a:faa5:: fcbb:bb00:5:: 00:aa:00:00:00:05
